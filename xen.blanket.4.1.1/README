This version of Xenblanket is tested on CentOS5.6 and Fedora14. Follow the instructions to install
on your own system

0. Install necessary packages in order to build Xen and Dom0 Linux Kernel.

For Fedora, the followings are recommended:

yum groupinstall "Development Libraries"
yum groupinstall "Development Tools"

yum install transfig wget texi2html libaio-devel dev86 glibc-devel e2fsprogs-devel gitk mkinitrd iasl xz-devel bzip2-devel pciutils-libs pciutils-devel SDL-devel libX11-devel gtk2-devel bridge-utils PyXML qemu-common qemu-img mercurial

yum install glibc-devel.i686

For more details, see http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/Fedora13Xen4Tutorial

1. Run "make" to build both Xen and Dom0 for Xenblanket. Alternatively, you can run "make Xen" or "make Linux" to build Xen and Dom0 separately.

2. Run "make Install" to install the Xen and Dom0 Kernel under /boot directory

3. Change the grub, add XENBLANKET and XENBLANKET-DEBUG(for debugging means), as an example, see the sample grub.conf given in this folder. "tdt=0" is necessary in order for emulated APIC timer to tick normally.
